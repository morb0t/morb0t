# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm ELHARDA Anouar, a student at the National School of Engineers in Brest, specializing in electronics engineering. I'm passionate about embedded systems and enjoy delving into the intricacies of hardware-software interactions.

## Education

ðŸŽ“ Currently pursuing a degree in Electronics Engineering at the National School of Engineers in Brest.

## Projects

### ðŸŒž Digital Light Sensor Project
I'm currently working on a digital light sensor project using STM32F411 microcontroller and TSL2561 sensor. The aim is to develop a robust system for accurately measuring ambient light levels, with potential applications in automatic brightness adjustment, environmental monitoring, and more.

### ðŸ¤– Mobile Robot
In addition to the light sensor project, I'm also involved in the development of a mobile robot. This project involves designing and implementing control algorithms, sensor integration, and navigation systems for autonomous or semi-autonomous operation.

### ðŸ“Š Student Attendance System
I developed a system to track student attendance in classes, simplifying attendance monitoring processes and improving efficiency in educational environments.
